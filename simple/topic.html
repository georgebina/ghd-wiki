            <h1>LW-DITA</h1>
            <div>Lightweight DITA can be used in the 
               <div>ghd-wiki</div> project, thus you can take
               advantage of controlled authoring experience by providing placeholders, hints, inline
               actions
               and inline form controls. 
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Lightweight DITA is a great alternative to Markdown, having the same or less complexity
                  degree while being very clearly specified. The user interface takes advantage of controlling
                  the authoring experience through placeholders, hints, inline actions and form controls
                  to edit
                  attribute values in place, all these combined to provide a simple user interface suitable
                  for
                  any contributors
               </p>
               <p>It is very easy to create content in LW-DITA, especially if you can benefit of some
                  help from
                  the authoring tool. The 
                  <a href="https://oxygenxml.com/xml_web_author.html">oXygen XML Web Author</a> is an example of such a tool, that provides
                  special support for working with LW-DITA, support that can be extended further to
                  match your
                  actual needs.
