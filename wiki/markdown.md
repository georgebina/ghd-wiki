# Markdown


Markdown can also be used to create pages, so people with Markdown only knowledge will still be able to create a page and use Markdown as the source for that.

For now the editing of Markdown content is directed to the [Github](http://www.github.com/index.html) built-in editors. In the future we plan to support Markdown editing similar to the one already available in the [oXygen XML Editor](http://www.oxygenxml.com/index.html) also in the [oXygen XML Web Author](https://oxygenxml.com/xml_web_author.html) thus providing

* syntax highlight 
* specific Markdown smart actions and toolbar
* live DITA preview
